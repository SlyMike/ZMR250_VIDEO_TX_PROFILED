# ZMR250_VIDEO_TX_PROFILED
Video TX for ZMR250 frame with 12x WS2512 LEDs.
Use the board with vertical antenna for best results.

Small switch mode power supplies are available on Ebay, solder directly to under side.
LM1117 3V3 linear regulater may be used for low power applications but not recomended (25mW).
Solder bridge jumper is provided for powering TX on 5V where possible.
Place jumper across 3V3OUT and ENABLE to turn on TX module.


I hope you find this project helpful, maybe it's worth a coffee?
